    "text": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nElectrophoresis is a technique used in biophysics and Cell Biology to study the movement of small molecules, such as ions or proteins, through a gel. It involves the use of an electric current to push charged particles toward one end of the gel, allowing their mobility to be measured.\n\n### Key Components:\n1. **Electrophoretic Force (EFF):** The force that moves the charged particles against the direction of their movement.\n2. **Electric Field:** Created by applying a voltage across the gel, which drives the movement of the particles.\n3. **Gel:** A matrix containing both negatively and positively charged components.\n\n### Types:\n- **Positive Electrophoretic Force (PEF):** Particles move toward the positive terminal of the electricity source.\n- **Negative Electrophoretic Force (NEF):** Particles move toward the negative terminal, typically used in research to study proteins.\n\n### Applications:\n1. **Ion Mobility:** Used to measure the size and charge distribution of cations (positive ions) in biological samples.\n2. **Protein Analysis:** A key technique in proteomics for studying protein movement under electric fields.\n3. **Bacterial Studies:** Used to study bacterial DNA, flagella, and cell walls.\n\n### Example:\n- **Electrophoretic Mobility Shift (EMS):** The difference in mobility between proteins in a sample versus a control is measured as an electrophoretic shift on the gel.\n\nElectrophoresis provides valuable insights into molecular dynamics and interactions within biological samples."
